// Type Casting: 
// Converting data from one type to another type is called type casting.
// There are two types of type casting:
// 1. Implicit Type Casting: In this type of casting, the compiler automatically converts the data from one type to another type.(Conversion)
// 2. Explicit Type Casting: In this type of casting, the programmer manually converts the data from one type to another type.(Casting)
